# Family Chore Management App

A collaborative web application designed to help families manage household chores fairly and efficiently through a unique personal value system.

## Overview

The Family Chore Management App addresses common household challenges by allowing family members to:
- Create and schedule chores (one-time or recurring)
- Assign personal "dislike values" to tasks (1-10 scale)
- Pick chores on a first-come, first-served basis
- Earn value points based on how much others dislike the tasks they complete
- Track contributions and performance statistics
